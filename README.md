# What is this project?

The assessment asked for a website with three pages to be created all about your hometown with the use of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to allow for the website to truly show
what your hometown has to offer. Using the design specifications and content requirements given, alongside demonstrating proper understanding of how to work with github
repositories and regularly committing where appropriate.

## Design Choices for this project
- The use of the bootstrap widget carousel for the homepage that the user can interact with (with it auto scrolling through on a timer) as a preview of the page as not to
  overwhelm the user on the homepage, rather just allow them to look through relevant images

- The colour palette throughout is softer, more neutral tones that work with the general banner colour scheme (picked from a colour generator) to draw less attention to the colours
  and more on the content. Also as to not clash with anything presented on the pages, opting for subtle colouring leaves the pages feeling less murky, rather clean.
- The font sizing and colouring were to tie in with the overall website colour palette. This was done by adding a darker colour behind the text and using the background web page colour
  to be the font colour. The text size was a choice as a middle ground between being too small or large on different devices.

-  For the visit page the use of hover CSS techniques were used to give a more user interactive feel to the page. When the user hovers over the images, a piece of text will slide
  over the image giving the user more information as to the significance of the image. Alongside this, there is a button with a link to an external webpage with further information
  should they choose.

- For the banner, a simple, type-writing adjacent font was selected. This was to promote a 'clean' feeling to the page and not draw attention away from the information. The writing
  was centred within the bottom half of the banner with a line filling the space between the town name and other essential info. This was a stylistic choice to give more character.
  The images behind the text were tailored to the content of each web page topic so that there was sense to the reasoning of the images chosen.

- In both the homepage and the visit page there are maps. For the homepage (as per the requirements) there is a static map of the town. Within the visit page, there is an interactive map
  situated at the bottom of the page. This was decided as it allows the user to scope out the area and hopefully aid in planning their travels to and from without having to leave the page.

## Challenges Faced
- Interaction with nested divs proved to be difficult at the beginning and somewhat messy. To try and work around this, spacing was used alongside any unnecessary divs were removed by grouping content within the same div.
- Having multiple duplicate CCS style choices. A lot of style choices made were similar across quite a few of the attributes seen within the website. To minimise any duplications, using IDs and Classes to group similar attribute styles proved to aid in this problem.
- Codio preventing external links being accessed in static preview. When using external links, codio proved to not execute the prompt to take the user to the website. Within a browser however, this was not presented as an issue.
